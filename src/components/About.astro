      <p>
        It took me a while to realize that design is everywhere.
        No matter where you look, feel, or interact, everything aims to solve a
        problem and has its own purpose, regardless if it came from nature or it
        was manufactured. Since I learned these lessons and many others in my
        graduation in Design back in 2012, which was mostly focused on product
        design, I’ve been trying to introduce most of the concepts from the
        design process to different areas of my professional life, as much as I
        can.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my early coding career, which started in mid 2010, I realized that at
        some level I could find the same problems both in conceptual design and
        digital products. Because of that, I found in the ReactJs community many
        opportunities to improve the way we interact with web applications, and
        as a result, I could narrow the gap between the effort of building solid
        applications with a great user experience. These challenges have helped
        me shape the necessary skills to become a front-end developer driven by
        problems to be solved.
      </p>

      <p>
        This journey brought me to CodeSandbox, where I’m proud that my work
        gets to many developers and it makes their life easier, providing a
        remarkable experience to express their own ideas through coding, and
        making products more enjoyable. Furthermore, <strong>the kinds of challenges I
        face every day make me go beyond what inspires me and make me not only
        solve problems but empower users to solve their problems themselves.</strong>
